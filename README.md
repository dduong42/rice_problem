Funny interview question given by a coworker @[ltbesh](https://github.com/ltbesh)

## The problem:

Given a chessboard with in each square a certain amount of rice grains. Find the path from the first square (top-left) to the last square (bottom-right) that gives you the most quantity of rice grains. The algorithm must be `O(nm)` in space and time (`nm` = the size of the chessboard).

## Hints:

Hints are given in the `hints` branch.
